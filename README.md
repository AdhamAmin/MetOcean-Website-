## Customization Guide

### Changing Colors

Update CSS custom properties in the `:root` selector:

```css
:root {
    --primary-green: #28a745;      /* Your brand green */
    --secondary-green: #20c997;    /* Accent green */
    --deep-blue: #003366;          /* Headers/backgrounds */
    --light-gray: #f8f9fa;         /* Backgrounds */
    --dark-gray: #343a40;          /* Secondary text */
    --accent-yellow: #ffc107;      /* Highlights */
}
```

### Adding New Pages

1. Create new page content div:
```html
<div id="newpage" class="page-content" style="display:none;">
    <!-- Your content here -->
</div>
```

2. Add navigation link:
```html
<li><a href="#newpage" onclick="showPage('newpage')">New Page</a></li>
```

### Modifying Content

- **Hero Section**: Update text in `.hero` section
- **Services**: Modify `.cards-grid` items in Services page
- **Team Members**: Edit `.team-member` entries in About page
- **Contact Info**: Update footer contact details

---

## Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Pages not switching
- **Solution**: Check JavaScript console for errors, ensure `showPage()` function is working

**Issue**: Styles not applying
- **Solution**: Check for CSS syntax errors, verify class names match

**Issue**: Forms not submitting
- **Solution**: Current implementation uses `alert()` for demo; integrate with backend for production

### Performance Tips

1. **Optimize images**: Use WebP format, compress before upload
2. **Minify CSS/JS**: Use build tools for production
3. **Enable caching**: Set appropriate cache headers
4. **Use CDN**: For static assets and Font Awesome
5. **Lazy load**: Implement for images below the fold

---

## Security Considerations

### Current Status (Frontend Only)
- No sensitive data stored
- No backend integration
- Forms are demonstration only

### Production Requirements
1. **Authentication**
   - Implement secure password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Use HTTPS for all connections
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting on login attempts

2. **Data Protection**
   - Input sanitization
   - XSS prevention
   - SQL injection prevention (if using SQL)
   - Secure session management

3. **Admin Portal**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Audit logging
   - Two-factor authentication (2FA)
   - IP whitelisting (optional)
